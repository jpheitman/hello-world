# hello-world
This is an example of some edits which could be made to a GitHub file on a branch.
Branches are used to experiment and test code, making sure everything works.
If the experiment works, we can merge the branch back into the master branch.
If not, no big deal; we can keep the branch separate as a reference or just discard it.
The master won't be affected until everything works.
